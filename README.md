## welcome to my github homepage

here are some links to other pages which I control:

### [my math department page](http://math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/)

has some stuff I have worked on, and also some personal projects.

### [groudhog day](http://aldenmb.github.io/GroundhogDay)

is a game I am working on, which aims to replicate Spry Fox's old game Leap Day.
