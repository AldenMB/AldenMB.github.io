##welcome to my github homepage

here are some links to other pages which I control:

#my math department page

has some stuff I have worked on, and also some personal projects. That is at [math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa].

#groudhog day

is a game I am working on, which aims to replicate Spry Fox's old game Leap Day. That is at [./GroundhogDay].
