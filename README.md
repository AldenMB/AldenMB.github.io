## welcome to my homepage

> When some people ask, "When am I ever going to use this?" what they are really asking is "When am I ever going to value this?" They're equating math's value with utility because they haven't seen that they can value anything more. A grander, more purposeful vision of mathematics would tap into the desires that can entice us to do mathematics as well as the virtues that mathematics can build.
