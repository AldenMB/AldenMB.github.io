Summary: A little puzzle involving a circle with inscribed squares


I found a fun puzzle last week, which I would like to share with you. It concerns the following figure.

You are given a right-angled circle sector, with a square inscribed. Beside the square another square is inscribed. The question for you is: how big are the squares? To make things easier, let's say the circle has a radius of $\sqrt{250}$. What, then, are the side lengths of the inscribed squares?
