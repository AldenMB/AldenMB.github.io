Summary: Where to find my latest publication

Three months ago, I shared an original proof of Descartes's theorem [here on my blog]({filename}descartes_theorem_proof.md). Today it was finally published! It will be part of the december issue of The Mathematical Intelligencer, but [you can already find it online](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00283-022-10234-6). I made several improvements for clarity, so I consider that version to be definitive. If you don't have access though your library, you can read [a preprint on ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05539) which is almost the same, just with a few more typos.
