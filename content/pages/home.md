My name is Alden Bradford. I am currently wrapping up a PhD in applied mathematics at Purdue university. I am looking for a job programming computers and analyzing data starting in the Fall of 2023. If you are hiring, [please send me an email](mailto:aldenbradford@gmail.com). 

Below are links to a few projects which I have created which I am particularly proud of.

# [An emulator for a common scientific calculator](calculator_emulator)

My favorite scientific calculator is the TI-30Xa. We use it at Purdue in many of the math courses I have taught. In order to make it easier to show the calculator in class, and help students practice using it when they only have their phones, I wrote an emulator in JavaScript which runs in the web browser. Most of the features have been implemented by now, though a few are yet to come. I have followed a strict pattern of test driven development here, which is particularly well-suited to this case since the desired final behavior is entirely prescribed: it should do what the real calculator does. Now that it is functional, the next step for this project is to build a test circuit from a genuine TI-30Xa so that I can generate test cases automatically. You can follow the development [on GitHub](https://github.com/AldenMB/calculator_emulator).

# [A Scikit-Learn compatible implementation of the nTARP clustering algorithm](NTarp)

This uses some novel optimizations which I discovered, allowing the whole procedure to be run efficiently in a vectorized manner.

# [A list of readings relevant to antiracism in mathematics](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/antiracist_reading_group/reading_list/)

This was generated by the Purdue Math Antiracism Reading Group, which has mostly been coordinated by me and [my wife](https://nt-tl.net/).

# [A tool to generate Apollonian gaskets](Apollo)

This uses a clever algorithm which was first published in 2001. This was used to make some posters to decorate the Purdue math department.

# [A Spanish/English translation dictionary](https://matemath.net)

This is a collaboration between myself and [Sofía Martínez Alberga](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~mart1789/). We were disappointed by the existing translation tools for bilingual mathematicians, so we decided to do something about it.


# [A tool for teaching complex analysis to middleschool students](ConformalMapViewer)

This was made hurriedly to help [my sister](https://laurestine.github.io/) teach complex analysis concepts to middle school students during the height of the Covid 19 pandemic. It is also a fun place to play around distorting images.
