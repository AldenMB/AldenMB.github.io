<p>My name is Alden Bradford. I made this site to share my projects with people. You can read the latest on my blog following the link above. Below are links to a few projects which I have created which I am particularly proud of. <a rel="me" href="https://types.pl/@Alden"></a></p>
<h1><a href="calculator_emulator">An emulator for a common scientific calculator</a></h1>
<p>My favorite scientific calculator is the TI-30Xa. We use it at Purdue in many of the math courses I have taught. In order to make it easier to show the calculator in class, and help students practice using it when they only have their phones, I wrote an emulator in JavaScript which runs in the web browser. Most of the features have been implemented by now, though a few are yet to come. I have followed a strict pattern of test driven development here, which is particularly well-suited to this case since the desired final behavior is entirely prescribed: it should do what the real calculator does. Now that it is functional, the next step for this project is to build a test circuit from a genuine TI-30Xa so that I can generate test cases automatically. You can follow the development <a href="https://github.com/AldenMB/calculator_emulator">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h1><a href="Apollo">A tool to generate Apollonian gaskets</a></h1>
<p>This uses a clever algorithm which was first published in 2001. This was used to make some posters to decorate the Purdue math department.</p>
<h1><a href="https://matemath.net">A Spanish/English translation dictionary</a></h1>
<p>This is a collaboration between myself and <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~mart1789/">Sofía Martínez Alberga</a>. We were disappointed by the existing translation tools for bilingual mathematicians, so we decided to do something about it.</p>
<h1><a href="ConformalMapViewer">A tool for teaching complex analysis to middleschool students</a></h1>
<p>This was made hurriedly to help <a href="https://laurestine.github.io/">my sister</a> teach complex analysis concepts to middle school students during the height of the Covid 19 pandemic. It is also a fun place to play around distorting images.</p>
