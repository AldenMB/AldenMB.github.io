# Pinball Science

## the game

One of my favorite video games from childhood was Pinball Science. It seems that it was mostly sold (in the US in any case) at Scholastic book fairs, to accompany the book The Way Things Work by David Macaulay. It's hard to find much about it online. The best source I have found is [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VeQDGTrruA), where someone in a similar situation to me managed to get it running in a virtual machine. I have had no luck running it on a virtual machine. This is not terribly surprising, since it never ran particularly well even when it was new -- the loading times were long, and it was prone to graphical glitches and crashes. The only way I have personally gotten it working in recent years was by installing Windows 98 on a contemporaneous laptop.

## installation woes

If you want to run it, you may find yourself in a pickle due to a subtle problem. Pinball Science is compatible with Windows XP, but not every version is compatible. If you go looking online, you may find ISO copies of the disk. Out of all those I have checked, none will run on XP without additional configuration. This is because Pinball Science relied on behavior which changed in Windows XP Service Pack 1. The DK website (when it was still up) claimed that they did publish a version of the disk which is compatible with XP including later service packs, but I have never found a copy of that disk.

Do not dispair: they published a patch which I have used before with success. It used to be available for download [from their website](support.selectsoft.com/products/A/LDAMAFAMEJ.htm#Downloads), but their website went offline many years ago. Archive.org does [have a backup of that website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061127031515/support.selectsoft.com/products/A/LDAMAFAMEJ.htm) including [a backup of that patch file](https://web.archive.org/web/20061127031515/http://support.selectsoft.com/download/SP1fix.exe). Just in case, I have also [hosted that file here](SP1fix.exe). For what it's worth, here is a link to [another patch from that publisher](https://web.archive.org/web/20050209013234/http://www.learnatglobal.com/html/xp_sound.html), which claims to be compatible with service pack 2 and has a different file name; however, the files appear to be identical. I have also [rehosted that patch here](SPupdate.exe), just in case.

## multiple versions

I have found at least two versions of the installation disk, and I believe there are more. These are the two versions I have in my posession. I have posted ISO copies of these disks [on my Github](https://github.com/AldenMB/AldenMB.github.io/releases/tag/Pinball_Science).

### Scholastic

This seems to be the earlier one; all the files on it have a modification date of 1998 or earlier. When loaded on Windows, the name of the disk reads as DKMMTWSW.

### Global Software Publishing

This one is more recent, as some of its files have a modification date of May 15 2002. Since XP Service Pack 1 would not be released until November of that year, it seems unlikely that this would have the service pack 1 patch. Notably, it appears to have dropped support for MacOS, presumably because OS X came out the previous year and would be incompatible with this game, which was written with System 7 in mind. When you load this in Windows, the name of the disk reads as Dkmmtwsw.
